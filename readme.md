# Joke App

## How to Run

* To start the server: in `backend` dir run `npm start`
* To start the client: in `frontend` dir run `npm start`

You should now be able to view the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Implementation

The backend is implemented with Node+Express and the frontend with React.

## Future Work

* Store data in a database rather than memory
* Add test suite
